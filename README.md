Endometriosis Lesion Detection Using machine learning
This project integrates YOLOv5, a robust object detection algorithm, with ResNet, a powerful convolutional neural network, to detect endometriosis lesions from medical images. Targeted at healthcare providers and researchers, this tool aids in early detection and diagnosis of endometriosis, supporting improved patient care and treatment planning.

features
Features Object Detection: YOLOv5 is utilized to accurately detect and localize endometriosis lesions within medical images, providing precise diagnostic support.

Classification with ResNet: ResNet is employed for lesion classification, enhancing the system's ability to distinguish between different types and stages of endometriosis.

Interactive Web Interface: Developed with Streamlit, the application offers an intuitive user interface for uploading medical images, viewing detection results, and accessing diagnostic insights.

Real-Time Processing: Enables rapid processing and analysis of medical images, facilitating timely clinical decision-making and patient consultation.

Deployment Flexibility: Deployable locally or on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable and accessible deployment options.
